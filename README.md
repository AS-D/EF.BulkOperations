# EF.BulkOperations

This project is a port of **Boris Djurdjevic** excellent **[EFCore.BulkExtensions](https://github.com/borisdj/EFCore.BulkExtensions)** project to .NET Framework.

## Usage

It's pretty simple and straightforward.
Bulk Extensions are extension methods on `DbContext` class and can be used as the following:

```
context.BulkInsert(usersToInsert, optionalConfig);
context.BulkUpdate(usersToUpdate, optionalConfig);
context.BulkDelete(usersToDelete, optionalConfig);
```

**BulkMerge** can be used if you need to do bulk operations like `upsert` (insert or update at once).

```
context.BulkMerge(usersToMerge, bulkMergeOperationType, optionalConfig);
```

> Note: Async methods are not supported.

**BulkMergeOperationType** is a `Bitwise Enum` with the following values:

- Insert
- Update
- Delete

> A `Bitwise Enum` implies you can specify any combination. For example, an `upsert` would be represented like the following expression: `BulkMergeOperationType.Insert | BulkMergeOperationType.Update`.

## BulkConfig arguments

**BulkInsert**, **BulkUpdate**, **BulkDelete**, **BulkMerge** methods can have optional argument **BulkConfig** with following properties:

If a different behavior is intended, create a new instance of `BulkConfig`, set the desired properties to their desired value, then pass it to bulk extension methods.

### SetOutputIdentity

When **SetOutputIdentity** is set to `True`, you have to set ordered value to your identity column.
For example if table already has rows, let's say it has 1000 rows with Id-s (1:1000), and we now want to add 300 more.
Since Id-s are generated in Db we could not set them, they would all be 0 (int default) in list.
But if we want to keep the order as they are ordered in list then those Id-s should be set say 1 to 300 (for BulkInsert).
Here single Id value itself doesn't matter, db will change it to (1001:1300), what matters is their mutual relationship for sorting.
Insertion order is implemented with TOP in conjuction with ORDER BY [stackoverflow:merge-into-insertion-order](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/884187/merge-into-insertion-order).

> As a general rule, for sorting to be preserved, set ascending ordered negative values to the identity property for values to insert.
> In case of a upsert operation (using **BulkMerge**), don't forget to sort the list of items before calling the operation.<br />
> Example: if we have a list of 8000 entries to insert, say 3000 for update (they keep the real Id) and 5000 for insert then Id-s could be (-5000:-1).

**SetOutputIdentity** is useful when **BulkInsert** is done to multiple related tables, that have Identity column.
After Insert is done to first table, we need Id-s that were generated in Db because they are FK(ForeignKey) in second table.

### IsBulkResultEnabled

When **IsBulkResultEnabled** is set to `True` the result is added to the provided **BulkConfig**, in **BulkResult** property which itself contains the following properties:

| Name     | Type | Description                 |
| -------- | ---- | --------------------------- |
| Inserted | int  | The number of inserted rows |
| Updated  | int  | The number of updated rows  |
| Deleted  | int  | The number of deleted rows  |

### UseTempDB

When **UseTempDB** is set to `False`, temporary tables will be created next to other tables.
